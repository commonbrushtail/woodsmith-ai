## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting v1.1:
- Linked variation groups with per-product entry selection (flexible: shared groups reduce repetitive data entry, per-product picks allow customization)
- Start fresh for variations, keep existing product_options (avoids risky data migration)
- Only variation_groups has updated_at column (entries and links are immutable)
- UNIQUE constraint on (product_id, entry_id) prevents duplicate variation links
- variation_groups and variation_entries allow unrestricted public read (shared catalog)
- product_variation_links filter by products.published for public read (matches product_images/product_options pattern)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
