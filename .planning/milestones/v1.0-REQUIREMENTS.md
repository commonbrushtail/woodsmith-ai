### Test Coverage

- [x] **TEST-01**: Failing test written before each bug fix (TDD red phase) — *All 5 bugs had failing tests first*

- [x] **TEST-03**: Edge case tests added for HTML stripping and sort order logic — *15 stripHtmlTags tests, 6 gallery order tests*
- [x] **TEST-04**: All 202+ existing tests still pass after fixes (no regressions) — *393 passing (3 pre-existing failures unchanged)*
